DE.RALPH-SCHLEICHER.ISO-2533

ISO 2533:1975 standard atmosphere.

Includes ISO 2533:1975/Add 1:1985 which provides hypsometrical
tables, that is geopotential altitude as a function of barometric
pressure.

Includes ISO 2533:1975/Add 2:1997 which extends the standard
atmosphere from -2000 m down to -5000 m geopotential altitude.

Since ISO 2533 is intended for use in calculations and design of
flying vehicles, we use the term ‘altitude’ instead of ‘height’
or ‘elevation’.

The ISO 2533 standard atmosphere is also known as international
standard atmosphere (ISA).  The ISO 2533 standard atmosphere is
equal to the ICAO standard atmosphere.

Non-standard ISA day conditions are usually modeled by adding
a temperature offset to the ISA day temperature.  All functions
of the ISO 2533 library are designed in such a way that you can
calculate air properties for a non-standard temperature.

Air properties are always static quantities unless explicitly
documented otherwise.
