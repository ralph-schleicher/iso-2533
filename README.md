# International Standard Atmosphere

ISO 2533:1975 standard atmosphere.

Includes ISO 2533:1975/Add 1:1985 which provides hypsometrical
tables, that is geopotential altitude as a function of barometric
pressure.

Includes ISO 2533:1975/Add 2:1997 which extends the standard
atmosphere from -2000 m down to -5000 m geopotential altitude.

Since ISO 2533 is intended for use in calculations and design of
flying vehicles, we use the term ‘altitude’ instead of ‘height’
or ‘elevation’.
